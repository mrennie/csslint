# Contributor License Agreement

A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your code. We've put a lot of work into creating a CLA that is simple, effective, and as clear as possible so that it doesn't disrupt contributions to CSS Lint.

When you make a contribution to the CSS Lint project, you agree:

* The code you wrote is your original work (you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
* To grant the CSS Lint project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted code in any way.
* You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.

By submitting a fix to CSS Lint you agree to the above statements.
